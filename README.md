# Skydrop
Snapdrop clone
This project was great and filled with challenges of working with Socket.io and WebRTC and making them work with Render.com which is the deploying solution used for this.
Currently this has been tested only in Chrome browser.

Open [SkyDrop](https://skydrop.onrender.com/) in two devices under same WiFi and share files between them. Device names will be shown in the page.
